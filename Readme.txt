Hello!

The project is made in two versions, one with socket and another with http requests.

The socket version was made first, and then send to Orion before the deadline.
Then after receiving only on Monday morning an answer to my first question from David, I could make a second solution, wich was uploaded after the deadline (Monday 03pm).

So Could you please, consider my second solution?
Thank you for your comprehension.
